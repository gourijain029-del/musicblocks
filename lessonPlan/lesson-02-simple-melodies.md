# Lesson 2: Creating Simple Melodies

**Grade Level**: 4-8  
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes  
**Prerequisites**: Lesson 1 (First Steps)

## Objectives

Students will:
- Understand note duration (whole, half, quarter notes)
- Create a recognizable melody
- Use the rhythm blocks effectively
- Share their work with others

## Materials

- Computers with Music Blocks
- Headphones
- Optional: Sheet music for "Hot Cross Buns" or "Mary Had a Little Lamb"

## Lesson Plan

### Review (5 minutes)

Quick check: Can everyone remember how to:
- Drag out a pitch block?
- Change the note name?
- Make blocks play together?

If not, do a quick refresher.

### New Concept: Note Duration (15 minutes)

Explain: "So far, all our notes have been the same length. But real music has short notes and long notes."

**Demo:**
- Drag out a pitch block (C4)
- Look at the number inside - that's how long it plays
- Change it from 4 to 8 - the note gets shorter
- Change it to 2 - the note gets longer

**The numbers:**
- 1 = whole note (longest)
- 2 = half note
- 4 = quarter note (most common)
- 8 = eighth note (quick)
- 16 = sixteenth note (very quick)

Have students try this themselves. Make a C note with duration 4, then 8, then 2. Hear the difference?

### Guided Activity: Hot Cross Buns (20 minutes)

"Let's make a song everyone knows."

**Hot Cross Buns melody:**
- E (quarter note)
- D (quarter note)
- C (quarter note)
- Rest
- E (quarter note)
- D (quarter note)
- C (quarter note)

Walk through it together:
1. Start with a "start" block
2. Add pitch blocks: E4, D4, C4
3. All should have duration 4 (quarter notes)
4. Add a "silence" block (from Rhythm palette) for the rest
5. Repeat: E4, D4, C4

Click play. Does it sound right?

**Troubleshooting together:**
- Too fast? The tempo might be set high
- Wrong notes? Double-check E-D-C
- Sounds choppy? Make sure blocks are connected

### Independent Practice (15 minutes)

Students choose one:

**Option 1: Mary Had a Little Lamb**
- E D C D E E E (rest) D D D (rest) E E E

**Option 2: Create your own**
- At least 6 notes
- Use at least 2 different note durations
- Must sound musical (not random)

### Sharing (10 minutes)

Have students pair up and play their melodies for each other.

Then ask for 2-3 volunteers to share with the whole class.

Questions to ask:
- What was challenging about this?
- How did you decide which notes to use?
- What would you do differently next time?

## Assessment

Students demonstrate understanding by:
- Creating a melody with varied note durations
- Explaining why they chose certain note lengths
- Successfully playing their composition

## Extensions

**For fast finishers:**
- Add more verses to your song
- Try making it faster or slower (change tempo)
- Experiment with different octaves

**Challenge:**
- Can you make your melody play twice using a repeat block?

## Common Issues

**"My song sounds wrong"**
- Check each note carefully
- Make sure durations match what you want
- Try playing it slowly first

**"I can't remember the melody"**
- That's okay! Look it up or make your own
- The goal is understanding duration, not memorization

**"This is too easy/hard"**
- Adjust! Easy = use the example. Hard = create your own complex melody

## Notes for Teachers

- Some students have musical training, others don't - both are fine
- If students don't know the example songs, let them create their own
- The key concept is note duration - make sure everyone gets that
- Sharing time is important - it builds confidence and community

## Vocabulary

- **Duration**: How long a note plays
- **Quarter note**: Standard note length (duration 4)
- **Melody**: A sequence of notes that makes a tune
- **Rest**: A moment of silence in music
