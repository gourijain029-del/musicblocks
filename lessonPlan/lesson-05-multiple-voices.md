# Lesson 5: Multiple Voices and Harmony

**Grade Level**: 6-10  
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes  
**Prerequisites**: Lessons 1-4

## Objectives

Students will:
- Create multiple musical voices simultaneously
- Understand basic harmony concepts
- Use multiple start blocks effectively
- Create a simple arrangement

## Materials

- Computers with Music Blocks
- Headphones
- Optional: Examples of songs with clear harmony (barbershop, choir music)

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction: What is Harmony? (5 minutes)

Play a clip of music with clear harmony (like a barbershop quartet or choir).

Ask: "What do you hear?"

Students might notice multiple melodies happening at once.

"That's harmony - when different musical lines work together. Today we'll create that in Music Blocks."

### Demo: Multiple Start Blocks (10 minutes)

"In Music Blocks, each start block is like a different musician."

**Show this:**
1. Create one start block with a simple melody (C-E-G)
2. Create another start block with a different melody (E-G-C)
3. Click the run button (not individual start blocks)
4. Both play at the same time!

**Key point:** When you click run, ALL start blocks play together.

**Try different combinations:**
- Same melody, different octaves (sounds fuller)
- Different melodies that fit together (harmony)
- One melody, one rhythm (like a band)

### Guided Activity: Create a Round (15 minutes)

"A round is when the same melody starts at different times. Like 'Row, Row, Row Your Boat.'"

**Build together:**
1. Create a simple 8-note melody in one start block
2. Copy that entire start block
3. In the second one, add a "wait" block at the beginning (try 2 beats)
4. Run both - the second melody starts later!

**Experiment:**
- Try different wait times
- Try 3 or 4 voices
- What sounds good? What sounds messy?

### Independent Practice: Create an Arrangement (20 minutes)

Challenge: Create a piece with at least 2 voices that:
1. Sound good together
2. Are clearly different from each other
3. Create an interesting overall sound

**Ideas:**
- Melody + bass line (low notes)
- Melody + harmony (notes that fit)
- Melody + drums
- Two melodies that complement each other

**Tips:**
- Start with one voice, get it right
- Add the second voice
- Test frequently - do they sound good together?
- Adjust as needed

### Sharing and Reflection (10 minutes)

Students share in small groups first, then volunteers share with the class.

Discussion:
- What was challenging about making voices work together?
- How did you decide what the second voice should do?
- What sounds good? What doesn't?

## Assessment

Students show understanding by:
- Creating at least 2 distinct musical voices
- Making them play simultaneously
- Explaining their arrangement choices

## Extensions

**For advanced students:**
- Create 3 or 4 voices
- Make voices that trade off (one plays, then the other)
- Try creating a fugue (complex round)

**Music theory connection:**
- Research intervals (distance between notes)
- Learn which intervals sound consonant (pleasant) vs dissonant (tense)
- Try creating specific intervals in your harmony

## Common Questions

**Q: Why do my voices sound bad together?**  
A: Some note combinations clash. Try notes from the same scale, or notes that are 3 or 5 steps apart.

**Q: How do I make one voice quieter?**  
A: Use the "set volume" block (in the Volume palette).

**Q: Can I make voices start and stop at different times?**  
A: Yes! Use "wait" blocks and different length melodies.

## Notes for Teachers

- Harmony is complex - some students will struggle with what "sounds good"
- That's okay! Experimentation is the goal
- Some students have better musical ears than others - pair them up
- Encourage creative solutions - there's no one "right" answer
- If students are stuck, suggest starting with octaves (same notes, different octaves always work)

## Music Theory Concepts

This lesson introduces:
- **Harmony**: Multiple notes sounding together
- **Counterpoint**: Independent melodies that work together
- **Arrangement**: How different parts are organized
- **Texture**: The overall sound created by multiple voices

## Vocabulary

- **Voice**: A separate musical line
- **Harmony**: Notes that sound good together
- **Round**: Same melody starting at different times
- **Arrangement**: How musical parts are organized

## Real-World Connections

- Bands have multiple instruments playing together
- Choirs have soprano, alto, tenor, bass
- Orchestras have many sections playing different parts
- Even pop songs have melody, harmony, bass, and drums

Lesson 6: Pitch and Scales - We'll explore different scales and how they create different moods in music.
