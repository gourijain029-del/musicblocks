# Lesson 1: First Steps with Music Blocks

**Grade Level**: 4-8  
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes  
**Prerequisites**: None

## Objectives

Students will:
- Navigate the Music Blocks interface
- Create and play a simple note
- Understand the connection between blocks and sound
- Save their first project

## Materials

- Computers with internet access
- Headphones (optional but recommended)
- Music Blocks website: musicblocks.sugarlabs.org

## Lesson Plan

### Introduction (10 minutes)

Start by asking students: "What if you could make music by snapping together blocks like LEGO?"

Show a quick demo - drag a note block, click it, hear the sound. That's it. No complicated software to learn.

### Guided Exploration (20 minutes)

**Step 1: Open Music Blocks**
- Go to musicblocks.sugarlabs.org
- Click "New Project"
- Point out the main areas: palette (left), workspace (center), toolbar (top)

**Step 2: Your First Note**
- Find the "Pitch" palette (it's blue)
- Drag out a "pitch" block
- Click on it - you should hear a note!
- Try changing the note name (C, D, E, etc.)
- Try changing the octave number

**Step 3: Make a Melody**
- Drag out a "start" block (from the Action palette)
- Snap a few pitch blocks underneath it
- Click the start block to play your melody
- Rearrange the blocks to change the tune

### Independent Practice (15 minutes)

Challenge students to:
1. Create a 4-note melody
2. Make it play when they click the start block
3. Try at least 3 different notes

Walk around and help students who are stuck. Common issues:
- Blocks not snapping together (they need to be close)
- Can't hear sound (check volume/headphones)
- Confused about octaves (explain: higher number = higher pitch)

### Wrap-Up (10 minutes)

Have 2-3 volunteers share their melodies with the class.

Ask: "What was easier than you expected? What was harder?"

Show students how to save their work:
- Click the save icon (top right)
- Give it a name
- It saves in their browser

## Assessment

Students successfully complete the lesson if they can:
- Create a melody with at least 4 notes
- Play it using the start block
- Save their project

## Extensions

For students who finish early:
- Try adding more notes (can you make 8?)
- Experiment with different octaves
- Look at the "Rhythm" palette - what do those blocks do?

## Common Questions

**Q: Why can't I hear anything?**  
A: Check your volume. Make sure headphones are plugged in correctly. Try clicking a single pitch block to test.

**Q: My blocks won't connect!**  
A: Drag them closer together. You'll see a white highlight when they're about to snap.

**Q: What's an octave?**  
A: It's how high or low the note is. Try octave 4 (middle), then try 5 (higher) and 3 (lower).

## Notes for Teachers

- Some students will race ahead - that's fine! Have extension activities ready.
- Others will need more time - that's also fine. The goal is exploration, not perfection.
- If the whole class is stuck on the same thing, pause and do a quick demo.
- Save time at the end for sharing - hearing each other's work is motivating.
