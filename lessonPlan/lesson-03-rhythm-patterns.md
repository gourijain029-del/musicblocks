# Lesson 3: Understanding Rhythm

**Grade Level**: 4-8  
**Duration**: 45-60 minutes  
**Prerequisites**: Lessons 1-2

## Objectives

Students will:
- Understand beats and measures
- Create rhythmic patterns
- Use the repeat block effectively
- Combine rhythm and melody

## Materials

- Computers with Music Blocks
- Headphones
- Optional: Hand drums or desk tapping for rhythm exercises

## Lesson Plan

### Warm-Up: Feel the Beat (5 minutes)

Have everyone tap their desk in a steady rhythm. Count: 1-2-3-4, 1-2-3-4.

That's a beat. Music is built on beats.

Now try: TAP-tap-tap-tap, TAP-tap-tap-tap (emphasizing beat 1).

That's rhythm - the pattern of sounds within the beats.

### Introduction to Rhythm Blocks (10 minutes)

Open Music Blocks and explore the Rhythm palette (orange).

**Key blocks:**
- **Note value**: Sets how long notes play
- **Rhythm**: Creates a pattern of notes
- **Repeat**: Plays something multiple times

**Demo:**
Create a simple drum pattern:
1. Drag out a "start" block
2. Add a "repeat" block (set to 4)
3. Inside repeat, add a "note value" block (set to 4)
4. Inside that, add a "pitch" block (C4)

Click play - you hear the same note 4 times. That's a pattern!

### Guided Activity: Build a Drum Beat (20 minutes)

"Let's make something that sounds like a real drum."

**Step 1: Basic beat**
- Use the "drum" block instead of "pitch"
- Try "kick drum" - it's the deep boom sound
- Put it in a repeat block (4 times)
- Play it - boom boom boom boom

**Step 2: Add variety**
- After the kick drum, add a "snare drum"
- Pattern: kick-snare-kick-snare
- This is the most basic drum beat in music!

**Step 3: Make it repeat**
- Wrap your whole pattern in another repeat block
- Set it to repeat 4 times
- Now you have a full drum loop

**Step 4: Add complexity**
- Try adding hi-hat (the tss-tss sound)
- Experiment with different note values
- Make some notes shorter (8 or 16) for faster rhythms

### Independent Practice (15 minutes)

Challenge: Create a rhythm pattern that:
1. Uses at least 2 different drums
2. Repeats at least 4 times
3. Has some variation (not all the same)

Students can:
- Make a drum beat
- Create a rhythmic melody
- Combine both

Walk around and listen. Ask students: "What rhythm are you trying to create?"

### Sharing and Discussion (10 minutes)

Have students play their rhythms for a partner.

Then ask: "Who created something they're proud of?"

Let 2-3 students share with the class.

Discussion questions:
- What makes a rhythm interesting?
- How did you decide what to repeat?
- What was tricky about this?

## Assessment

Students show understanding by:
- Creating a repeating rhythm pattern
- Using at least 2 different sounds
- Explaining their rhythm choices

## Extensions

**For advanced students:**
- Create a rhythm that changes (A pattern, then B pattern)
- Try polyrhythm (two different patterns at once)
- Add melody notes on top of your drum beat

**Real-world connection:**
- Listen to a popular song - can you hear the drum pattern?
- Try to recreate it in Music Blocks

## Common Questions

**Q: What's the difference between rhythm and melody?**  
A: Rhythm is the timing pattern. Melody is the actual notes. You can have rhythm without melody (drums), but melody always has rhythm.

**Q: Why use repeat blocks?**  
A: They save time! Instead of copying the same blocks 10 times, just use repeat.

**Q: My rhythm sounds messy**  
A: Start simple. Get one pattern working, then add to it. Less is often more in rhythm.

## Notes for Teachers

- Some students will want to make complex patterns immediately - encourage them to start simple
- Others might struggle with the concept of patterns - use physical examples (clapping, tapping)
- The repeat block is powerful but can be confusing - make sure everyone understands it
- Rhythm is very personal - there's no "wrong" answer as long as it repeats consistently

## Cross-Curricular Connections

**Math**: Patterns, counting, fractions (note values)  
**Science**: Sound waves, frequency  
**Social Studies**: Different cultures have different rhythmic traditions  
**PE**: Movement and rhythm go together

## Vocabulary

- **Beat**: The steady pulse in music
- **Rhythm**: The pattern of sounds and silences
- **Pattern**: Something that repeats in a predictable way
- **Loop**: A section that plays over and over

Lesson 4: Loops and Patterns - We'll use programming concepts to create more complex musical structures.
